# A simple Python Pong game

Module Used :

- turtle

## Basic idea behind it:

Both the paddle and ball are basically turtles.The paddle turtles move up and down using a onkeypress command and Ball moves with an auto incremental loop[changing directions on wall touch or paddle touch]

Ball resets to center when someone misses and start in opposit direction.

## areas of improvement:

- using Pygame module for more features
- storing the scores in external file
- adding mods;
